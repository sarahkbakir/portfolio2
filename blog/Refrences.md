-  **Exploring The world of Front end development**

## **Learning path**

I started my learning journey last year. I began practicing basic coding fundamentals through courses, then my Front-End Development interest became more and more everyday. I'm a step away from becoming a professional Front-End Developer, But I'm proud of what I achieved so far.

I started from scratch and I think resources and steps I took can be helpful to others. First thing I learned, and that would be   **_My Advice is to always go for the official Documentation, Always!_**, but other resources can be informative and helpful too.

There are some resources that helped me and others I knew about later but still would be very helpful to others during their learning journey.

## **Problem solving**

I love problem solving time, and unless I manage to make time limits for myself, I can spend everyday all day solving problems on platforms and learning tricks, ideas, concepts and methods. It's very challenging and rewarding. I would reccomend though starting with beginner level problems and leveling up rather than just going random because as a beginner failing at solving problems will be very disappointing.

I found a couple of lists of Problem Solving websites, tried some of them and would happily reccomend some of which I loved, found very entertaining and helpful.
