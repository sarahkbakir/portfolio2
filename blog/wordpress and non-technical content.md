## Wordpress, Art and Thoughts races!

### The start :
I started in 2015 exploring the world of blogging and content writing. I started writing at young age, I wrote my first poem at the age of 16 and my first short story at the age of 17. I started painting at the age of 6 and I actually still have a lot of my artwork at that age! I was lucky enough to grow up in a house that believed in art and creativity. We sang, danced, painted, joined acting classes and theater clubs in school, wrote and even published my poem in a local magazine.


I thought I was exploring the internet, but it turned out I was exploring myself!. I started expressing myself more with words, rather than just painting. I didn't see what I became today coming! I thought I would definetly end up as an artist!! creating beautiful art installations, art pieces, or just painting. An **electrical engineer** in the morning and an **Artist** later on. That's what I worked for and what I thought I were before exploring web developement!

Web Development which technically has the same concept **Creating something huge from scratch** as **Art**, but using different tools and using imagination differently.

I'm so glad and gratefull for what I became today, and I won't definetly stop learning new things everyday. It's really amazing how just few lines code can make huge differences.
